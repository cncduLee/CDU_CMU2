							<h2>Law</h2>
							<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves
								like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and
								got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week
								to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each
								other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
								only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking
								now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
								but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to
								man.</p>

							<h3>Policy</h3>
							<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place
								where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid
								with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where
								chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not
								rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to
								play by his rules, then you're gonna have to pay the price.</p>

							<h2>Policy</h2>
							<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender
								plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do
								you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face
								sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you
								put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
								store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're
								here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

							<h3>Excellence</h3>
							<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place

								chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not
								rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to

							<h2>Portfolio</h2>
							<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
								iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed
								is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the
								weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his
								brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will
								strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger
								those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
								you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon
								thee.</p>

							<h3>Examples</h3>
							<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a
								mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can
								tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite
								of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I
								should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of
								the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

							<h2>Contact</h2>
							<p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time
								travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's
								possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why
								fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters a black
								hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why
								don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told
								anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it
								back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive
								logic.</p>

							<h3>Get in touch</h3>
							<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
								show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people
								who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide
								if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and
								become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
								starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
