			<div class="read_info">Thailand is an incredible destination with
				palaces, temples, markets, shopping, spas, friendly people, fine
				dining and some of the best hotels in the world. The word 'Thai'
				means freedom, so literally Thailand is the land of freedom and
				Thailand proudly proclaims that, unlike its neighbours, it has never
				been colonised. This has allowed the kingdom to retain its unique
				culture, traditions and language. The ‘wai’, a traditional
				prayer-like greeting that can convey varying levels of respect
				depending on how it is performed, can be seen all across this
				beautiful country. With a long, rich heritage and abundant natural
				resources, from its mist-covered mountains in the north rising up to
				the Myanmar border, to the verdant limestone islands of the Andaman
				Sea, the tranquil villages moored along the Mekong River and the
				ever present pulsing energy of Bangkok, Thailand is without a doubt
				one of the most exotic destinations in Asia.
				<br /> In addition to being one of the world’s most rewarding travel
				destinations, Thailand is also the most convenient gateway for
				travelling to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia
				and Indonesia. Located in the hub of Southeast Asia, our Thailand
				DMC can assist with enquiries and arrange travel plans for these
				countries
